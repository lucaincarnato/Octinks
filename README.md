My game is a call to action that raises awareness of marine pollution, inviting people to stop wasting time, and take real-world actions to protect the marine ecosystem, by making them realize that, while they were playing, octopuses were dying because time was being wasted.

When designing my game, my primary goal was to craft an experience that provokes a fundamental shift in the player’s perspective—moving from engagement to realization, from play to responsibility. I wanted players to begin the game believing they were simply increasing a score, as in any other arcade game, only to later discover that the number they were trying to maximize represented something less empowering and more real: the number of octopuses dying due to marine pollution while they played. This moment of revelation is the core of the user experience I aimed to create, fostering an emotional impact that would prompt players to reconsider how they spend their time and, ideally, inspire them to take real-world action.
I have always been drawn to innovation and unconventional solutions, and using the Apple Pencil Pro as a core game mechanic seemed like the perfect challenge to unleash my creativity. The game fully leverages the Apple Pencil Pro’s features, not just as a traditional drawing tool but as an intuitive input system for movement and special abilities; the connection between octopuses and pens—linked by ink—made this choice even more fitting. The player controls the character by hovering the Apple Pencil over the screen, enabling precise and fluid movement while requiring focus and adaptability. To remove marine litter, players physically draw over obstacles, simulating an octopus releasing ink to clear its surroundings; additionally, the Apple Pencil Pro’s squeeze gesture activates a more powerful ink release, eliminating all visible obstacles at once. This interaction enhances immersion while reinforcing the game’s message about pollution and its impact on marine life.
Choosing PencilKit as the core framework was an intuitive decision, allowing me to explore new development tools and improve my adaptability to different frameworks. The biggest technical challenge I faced was integrating UIKit—a framework I had never used before—with the existing SwiftUI views. This required me to learn UIKit from scratch and establish seamless communication between the two frameworks, expanding my technical expertise in the process.
Despite always having a creative mindset, I never had the opportunity to explore conventional artistic expression. The Swift Student Challenge provided the perfect opportunity to push my boundaries and expand my skill set. Developing this project required me to learn how to draw, ensuring that every aspect of the game was entirely my own creation. This process allowed me to discover a new form of artistic expression, enriching both my personal and professional growth.
AI has become an invaluable tool for developers, especially when used thoughtfully. In this project, AI played a crucial role in debugging. During playtesting, whenever I encountered a bug, AI-assisted debugging, through commercial LLMs, helped me efficiently identify its root cause and provided multiple potential solutions. However, AI never dictated my creative choices—it simply accelerated the problem-solving process, allowing me to retain full control over the design and implementation of my game.

From the university building where I attend the Apple Developer Academy and my university lessons, I have a clear view of Naples’ sea; it is the same sea I laid my gaze on my entire life, the same sea I spent countless summers in and the same sea that provided me with the tastiest seafood dishes I have ever tried. Yet, it is the same sea that, several times, I have seen polluted. With my game I want to take actions and I want others to do it too, in order to let more and more children, as I once was, lay their gaze on that sea, to let more and more teens spend their summers with their friends in that sea and to let more and more people taste the fruits of that sea.
